# FIFA-20
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of FIFA 20 player data, focusing on various aspects such as player attributes, clustering based on skills, and exploratory data analysis to answer specific football-related questions.

## **Project Overview:**
The project is divided into several tasks:

**Task 1: Complete Data Analysis Report**

Objective: To conduct a thorough analysis of the FIFA 20 player data, including data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
Outcome: Provides insights into the distribution and characteristics of players, serving as a foundation for subsequent analyses.

**Task 2: Clustering Football Players Based on Their Attributes**

Objective: To explore and cluster football players based on their attributes using unsupervised learning techniques.
Approach:
Apply clustering algorithms such as K-means to group players with similar attributes.
Visualize clusters to understand player distributions across different skill sets.
Outcome: Identification of distinct clusters of players, which can be used for talent identification, scouting, or strategic planning.

**Task 3: Football Players Data Exploration and Question Analysis**

Objective: To answer specific questions about the football players, focusing on demographics, performance, and compensation.
Subtasks:
* Top 10 Countries Producing the Most Players:
Rank and list the top 10 countries with the most FIFA 20 players.
Insight: Determine which countries are the largest producers of professional footballers.
* Distribution of Overall Rating vs. Age:
Analyze and plot the relationship between player ratings and age.
Insight: Identify the age after which players typically stop improving their overall ratings.
* Comparison of Salaries Among Offensive Players:
Investigate which offensive positions (strikers, right-wingers, left-wingers) command the highest salaries.
Insight: Understand which position tends to have the highest market value.

## **Tools and Libraries:**

Python: Core programming language used.

Pandas, Numpy: For data manipulation and analysis.

Scikit-learn: For clustering and machine learning tasks.

Matplotlib, Seaborn: For data visualization.
